It's a simple tool where you can add a frame with text to your profile picture, just like on Linkedin. The difference is, you can fully customize the gradient colour, text and text colour. It ain't much, but it's honest work ðŸ˜‰

Why I made it? Some time ago, my friend (Tom Walsh)[https://www.northpeak.digital/], created a custom frame for me in Photoshop and since then, a lot of people asked me about it in personal messages. So I decided to create a solution for this problem ðŸ˜‰

I wanted to give credit to (Tom Walsh)[https://www.northpeak.digital/] for this idea and also thanks to Denis Kharchenko for helping me out with the UI.

Enjoy and share if you like it Cheers! ðŸ˜‰
